HW 6.1

The loop loops through a section of code as long as it is TRUE

function myFunction() {
    var text = "";
    var i = 6;
    while (i < 20) {
        text += "<br>The number is " + i;
        i++;
        The output of the code will give you..
        The number is 6
        The number is 7
        The number is 8
        and so on.  until it gets to
        The number is 19
        Then it stops and loops back to 6 then starts again.
        
        
The Do/while loop will execute without checking if it's true, but if it is the code will loop.
